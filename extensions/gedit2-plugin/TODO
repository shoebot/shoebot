TODO list for ShoebotIt
=======================

* have the errors show on the bottom Gedit pane
* proper syntax highlighting -- for now, one has to set it manually to
  'Python'; even better would be to add Shoebot specific functions so
  that they could be highlighted too
* fix as this broke badly with shoebot-dq
