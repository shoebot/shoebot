shoebot (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The Shoebot Editor (IDE) is back as an easy way to edit and run scripts.
    Its code has been substantially refactored as well. This feature is
    currently in alpha status, moving to beta on the 1.4 release after some
    testing.
  * New dark theme for the IDE.
  * Jupyter notebooks are now supported, through the use of the
    jupyter-shoebot extension.
  * PyPy support. Shoebot benefits from upstream fixes to both pycairo and
    pygobject, and now runs under PyPy without any special configuration.
  * Window scaling. Shoebot now renders at the window size instead of the bot
    size, meaning that paths will not become pixelated when the window is
    resized, and will stay smooth at any size.
  * Improved the installation process significantly, with package lists
    updated to play nice with most distros. Fedora and SUSE were particularly
    targeted here, improving many annoyances that made running Shoebot in
    these distros rather difficult.
  * Migrate graphics backend into PyCairo by default.
  * Easy toggle between Cairo/CairoCFFI and gi/pgi as a graphics backend.
    Recent work on the graphics backend now makes it possible to choose the
    Cairo and GObject bindings using an environment variable.
  * Many documentation additions and edits
  * Several bug fixes

shoebot (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Better install script, should work with pip and setup.py

 -- Ricardo Lafuente <rlafuente@ace> Sat, 23 Jan 2016 16:03:06 +0100


shoebot (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Livecoding branch merged
  * Shoebot shell for communication with editors / IDEs
  * Gtk3 branch merged, along with experimental support
    for pypy
  * Use 'vext' for Gtk, extra virtualenv setup scripts
    removed
  * Make setup.py clean actually remove all detritus
  * Support setup.py develop
  * Show shoebot icon in var window as well as main
    window
  * Started event framework to control different parts
    of SB; it's pretty dumb right now, but enough to support
    livecoding of dynamic and non dynamic bots.

  * Installable from `setup.py`, supports Windows
  * Made to work on Python 2.6, so Windows Gedit can be
    supported
  * Added Virtualenv chooser
  * Settings are persisted in DConf
  * Removed bash setup scripts
  * Livecoding support - seperate tab for live errors
  * Update examples search to work with `setup.py
    develop`

  * Re-enabeled the colors examples
  * Added Audio Examples
  * Added other misc examples (Fat Text, Fat Lines)

  The main focus of 1.2 has been on making installation
  easier, livecoding and making sure old branches don't go
  unused.

shoebot (0.4a4-1); urgency=low

  * Rewrite of the core code around drawing queues by
    Stuart Axon
  * Debian packaging scripts finally working

 -- Ricardo Lafuente <r@sollec.org> Sat, 26 Mar 2011 03:23:11 +0000

shoebot (0.3b-1); urgency=low

  * Huge code refactoring, now it should be a lot easier
    to hack around.
  * Gedit and Inkscape plug-ins now included

 -- Ricardo Lafuente <r@sollec.org> Mon, 11 Jan 2010 16:36:07 +0000

shoebot (0.2-1); urgency=low

  * colors can be specified using hexcolour values (e.g.
    #FF00FF)
  * fill and/or stroke values can be specified using
    keyword arguments (e.g. a = Rect(x,y,w,h,fill='#FF00FF'))
  * experimental animation support
  * internationalization
  * transforms were overhauled, and are now fully
    consistent with Nodebox behaviour
  * clipping paths!
  * a powerful text API was introduced using Pango,
    matching and even extending Nodebox's capabilities, and
    working great with transforms
  * image support is now there, and working great!
  * ximport() can now be used to import Nodebox's
    libraries
  * many Nodebox libraries ported and included in
    Shoebot! Boids, Cornu, Database, Ants, Photobot,
    Supershape, SVG and Web are fully working (as far as we
    could determine! :) ; Colors and L-System are partially
    working.
  * easteregg(x,y,size) ;)
  * GIMP colour palette import!
  * repeat mode (-r) in commandline mode to output
    multiple images
  * fullscreen mode!
  * new example scripts
  * Shoebot now runs on Windows, and the IDE too!
  * new goodies in the Shoebot IDE: error reporting
    console, layout dimensions, about item, file dialogue,
    Ctrl+F shortcut, GNOME Desktop entry
  * preliminary mouse events implementation in GTK mode

  Bug fixes:

  * drawpath() and findpath() are working; drawpath()
    can be used with images as well (load once, use many
    times)
  * bounding box calculations for line() are fixed
  * fixed order of buttons on quit - save file dialogue
    in shoebot-ide

  API changes:

  * big rewrite of the code structure; now there are
    generic Bot and Canvas classes, equivalent to a
    'context' and a 'surface', but differently named to
    avoid confusion with Cairo; those can be subclassed to
    implement new languages (see NodeBot? class for the
    implementation of Nodebox) and new graphical backends
    (see CairoCanvas?).
  * the 'Box' class was renamed to 'Bot'
  * oval() deprecated and introduced ellipse(), the
    correct term for this operation
