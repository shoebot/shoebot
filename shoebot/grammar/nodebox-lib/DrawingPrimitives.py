## nodebox compatibility - from nodebox1

# shoebot -
# Currently (2013-April) only has enough to make nodebox - evolution
# work - since this is obsolete unlikely that much more will need
# to be added.


# This file is obsolete.
# NodeBox now uses a package structure.
# The drawing primitives are now in the new "nodebox.graphics" package.
# This will also ensure you get the graphics package for the correct platform.
