Data structures for use in Shoebot

These are 'agnostic' classes for representing primitive shapes, paths, colors,
transforms, text and image objects, live variables and user interaction
elements (such as pointing devices).

The drawing objects could benefit from an actual, proper Python library to
handle them. We're anxiously awaiting for the lib2geom Python bindings :-)
