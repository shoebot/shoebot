Boids
-----

We're still in the process of porting the Nodebox library documentation to here.

In the meantime, read the original Nodebox documentation for the `Boids
library <https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Boids>`_, since it should
work just the same on Shoebot.

If it does not, please let us know by making a `new issue
<https://github.com/shoebot/shoebot/issues/new>`_ on the Shoebot repository.
