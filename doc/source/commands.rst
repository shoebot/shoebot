Reference and examples
======================

This is the full list of commands available in Shoebot.

Many parts of this reference were adapted from the original `Nodebox
documentation <https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Reference>`_ by Frederik
de Bleser and
Tom de Smedt.

Note that most examples here are drawn on a 100x100 size for simplicity; the
Shoebot default is 300x300px.
