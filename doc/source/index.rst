Shoebot
=======

Shoebot is a tool to automate the process of drawing vector graphics using a minimal and easy-to-understand syntax.

It is a rewrite of `Nodebox 1 <https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home>`_ by `Frederik de Bleser <https://www.enigmeta.com/>`_ and `Tom de Smedt <http://organisms.be/>`_, with the purpose of having an equivalent tool in GNU/Linux systems. Nodebox 1 is itself based on `DrawBot <http://www.drawbot.com/>`_ by Just van Rossum. Shoebot draws using the cross-platform `Cairo graphics engine <http://cairographics.org>`_.

It follows a rich lineage of tools dedicated to generative creativity:

  * `Design By Numbers <http://dbn.media.mit.edu/>`_
  * `Processing <http://processing.org>`_
  * `Scriptographer <http://scriptographer.org/>`_
  * `Paper.js <http://paperjs.org/>`_

For more about the nature of creative coding and generative design, be sure to read `The Nodebox 1 theoretical introduction <https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Introduction>`_.

Purpose
-------

Shoebot is a useful tool for many use cases:

* creating generative and procedural works, either for screen or print output
* teaching code to non-developers by means of immediate visual feedback
* prototyping visualizations and design concepts
* automatically generating sets of vector images
* live-coding and real-time tweaking of animated graphics
* making `Cairo <http://cairographics.org>`_-based tools and experiments using a simpler language

Features
--------

Originally built as a GNU/Linux version of Nodebox 1, Shoebot comes with many batteries included:

* supports most of Nodebox 1's functionality
* user-friendly code editor
* headless mode for quick execution without the GUI parts
* run on a window or output files in PDF, PNG, SVG or PS formats
* tweak running scripts via a simple GUI, a socket server or a text-based shell
* can be loaded as a Python module to work inside existing programs
