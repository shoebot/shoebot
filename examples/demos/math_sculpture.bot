"""
Math Sculpture
by the Nodebox authors

Generates sculptures using a set of mathematical functions.
Every iteration adds a certain value to the current coordinates.
Rewriting this program to use transforms is left as an exercise
for the reader.

This program uses some mathematical functions that are not
standard functions of NodeBox.
Instead, they are in Python's math library. The next
line imports those functions.
