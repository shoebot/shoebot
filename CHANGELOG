# 1.3.1

A couple of additions:

  * Ensure that the output window is redrawn on resize
  * Center the output image in the window
  * Add mnemonics for menus

And many bug fixes:

  * Fix ReadTheDocs output, docs now build properly again
  * Fix an issue where install would fail under PyPy
  * Don't commit Python eggs to the repository
  * Fix typo in install script that broke it
  * Virtualenv chooser in IDE does not die anymore if ~/.virtualenvs doesn't
  exist
  * Remove outdated mentions of requirements.txt in install docs
  * Fix buffer reference in IDE code
  * Fix weird behavior when saving in the IDE

# 1.3

  * The Shoebot Editor (IDE) is back as an easy way to edit and run scripts.
    Its code has been substantially refactored as well. This feature is
    currently in alpha status, moving to beta on the 1.4 release after some
    testing.
  * New dark theme for the IDE.
  * Jupyter notebooks are now supported, through the use of the
    jupyter-shoebot extension.
  * PyPy support. Shoebot benefits from upstream fixes to both pycairo and
    pygobject, and now runs under PyPy without any special configuration.
  * Window scaling. Shoebot now renders at the window size instead of the bot
    size, meaning that paths will not become pixelated when the window is
    resized, and will stay smooth at any size.
  * Improved the installation process significantly, with package lists
    updated to play nice with most distros. Fedora and SUSE were particularly
    targeted here, improving many annoyances that made running Shoebot in
    these distros rather difficult.
  * Migrate graphics backend into PyCairo by default.
  * Easy toggle between Cairo/CairoCFFI and gi/pgi as a graphics backend.
    Recent work on the graphics backend now makes it possible to choose the
    Cairo and GObject bindings using an environment variable.
  * Many documentation additions and edits
  * Several bug fixes

# 1.2.2

Small fixes to `sbaudio` library after pysoundcard API changes

# 1.2.1

Improvements to vext which ought to work to make Shoebot installable via `pip` and `setup.py install`

# 1.2

New features:

* Livecoding branch merged
* Shoebot shell for communication with editors / IDEs
* Gtk3 branch merged, along with experimental support for pypy
* Use 'vext' for Gtk, extra virtualenv setup scripts removed
* Make setup.py clean actually remove all detritus
* Support setup.py develop
* Show shoebot icon in var window as well as main window
* Started event framework to control different parts of SB; it's pretty dumb right now, but enough to support livecoding of dynamic and non dynamic bots.

## GEdit plugin changes

* Installable from `setup.py`, supports Windows
* Made to work on Python 2.6, so Windows Gedit can be supported
* Added Virtualenv chooser
* Settings are persisted in DConf
* Removed bash setup scripts
* Livecoding support - seperate tab for live errors
* Update examples search to work with `setup.py develop`

## Examples

* Re-enabeled the colors examples
* Added Audio Examples
* Added other misc examples (Fat Text, Fat Lines)

The main focus of 1.2 has been on making installation easier, livecoding and making sure old branches don't go unused.

# 1.0

For LibreGraphics meeting we made our 1.0 release, we also previewed the
Livecoding branch.

A number of nice examples were made by workshop attendees and added to
shoebot:
[INSERT LIST]

We also got lots of good feedback which should be incorporated into
future versions.

Note - this entry added later, by revisiting the commit log

# 1.0b

This was a pre-release in the runup to LibreGraphics Meeting.
We moved from gitorious to github in the interim.

New features:

* Re-enabled supershape - make it buildable with cython instead of C
* Redirect shoebot.net to github pages + make them primary.

Note - this entry added later, by revisiting the commit log

The main focus has once again been on improving compatibility
with nodebox, crossing a major milestone with the 'evolution'
example from nodebox working unmodified.

New features:
* Remove OS2 from setup.py.

Note - this entry added later, by revisiting the commit log

# 0.2

Shoebot got the love of some very talented hackers, and a truckload of lovely
features saw the light of day:

New features:
  * colors can be specified using hexcolour values (e.g. #FF00FF)
  * fill and/or stroke values can be specified using keyword arguments (e.g.
    a = Rect(x,y,w,h,fill='#FF00FF'))
  * experimental animation support
  * internationalization
  * transforms were overhauled, and are now fully consistent with Nodebox
    behaviour
  * clipping paths!
  * a powerful text API was introduced using Pango, matching and even
    extending Nodebox's capabilities, and working great with transforms
  * image support is now there, and working great!
  * ximport() can now be used to import Nodebox's libraries
  * many Nodebox libraries ported and included in Shoebot! Boids, Cornu,
    Database, Ants, Photobot, Supershape, SVG and Web are fully working (as
    far as we could determine! :) ; Colors and L-System are partially working.
  * easteregg(x,y,size) ;)
  * GIMP colour palette import!
  * repeat mode (-r) in commandline mode to output multiple images
  * fullscreen mode!
  * new example scripts
  * Shoebot now runs on Windows, and the IDE too!
  * new goodies in the Shoebot IDE: error reporting console, layout
    dimensions, about item, file dialogue, Ctrl+F shortcut, GNOME Desktop
    entry
  * preliminary mouse events implementation in GTK mode

Bug fixes:
  * drawpath() and findpath() are working; drawpath() can be used with images
    as well (load once, use many times)
  * bounding box calculations for line() are fixed
  * fixed order of buttons on quit - save file dialogue in shoebot-ide

API changes:
  * big rewrite of the code structure; now there are generic Bot and Canvas
    classes, equivalent to a 'context' and a 'surface', but differently named
    to avoid confusion with Cairo; those can be subclassed to implement new
    languages (see NodeBot class for the implementation of Nodebox) and new
    graphical backends (see CairoCanvas).
  * the 'Box' class was renamed to 'Bot'
  * oval() deprecated and introduced ellipse(), the correct term for this
    operation

# 0.1

  Shoebot says hello world!
